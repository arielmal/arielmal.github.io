</div><p> Hello! Welcome my name is Ariel Maldonado. I am a student at California State University, Monterey Bay, studying Business Information Systems. I was born and raised in a small town right outside of San Jose, California, which is Santa Clara most people think it is <a href=http:/www.levisstadium.com/> Levi's Stadium, </a>but my Santa Clara is more like walking into episode of <a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0539712/> Cheers </a>. <br><br>
          I was raised by a single mother and I am the youngest out of four daughters. My mother didn't believe in the word "cannot" because she said if I wanted something go out and make it happen; this word I would face so many times in my life. My ethic background is Mexican and Puerto Rican. My Mom side of the family is from <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morelia> Morelia </a>, Mexico and my father side is from <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponce,_Puerto_Rico>Ponce</a> Puerto Rican.   
          <br><br>

                      <font color=#CB0609 > <center><i>One of my favorite quotes <br>
"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. 
We are all meant to shine as children do. It's not just in some of us; it is in everyone. And as we let our own lights shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.Marianne Williamson"</font> </i> </center>
